# lidar_shenanigans
Lidar stuff I did for an assignment
lidar_building - Find the height of buildings using classified lidar data
lidar_roads - Measuring road geometry from lidar data

All the data is obtained from opentopography (https://opentopography.org/) but you can find it [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KA8J-yRjsMaDTy0whzYJJkH2d6C4rpoY?usp=drive_link) too.
